## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop displays, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for every visitor.
*   **Dynamic Navigation:** Implements Bootstrap's **Scrollspy** component, which automatically highlights the current section in the navigation bar as the user scrolls. This is paired with a custom JavaScript **smooth scrolling** effect for a fluid and intuitive user experience.
*   **Dynamic Content with GitHub API:** The "Projects" section dynamically fetches and displays real-time **star and fork counts** for my repositories by making asynchronous calls to the GitHub REST API, showcasing my ability to work with external data sources.
*   **Client-Side Form Validation:** The contact form includes robust, custom-built validation using JavaScript, providing immediate and user-friendly feedback without relying on native browser validation.
*   **Accessibility (a11y) Compliant:** The entire site was developed with accessibility in mind, passing automated checks to ensure it is usable by a wide range of audiences.
